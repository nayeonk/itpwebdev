Michal Handzus scored his second goal on a rebound with 2:21 to play, and the Kings  set the franchise record for consecutive wins with a 4-3 victory over  Detroit Red Wings on Saturday. &quot;We  didn't play a very good first, but I think it's been our attitude this  year that we're never out of a game, especially with the way things are  right now,&quot; said Brown, the Kings' captain. &quot;Winning nine games in a  row is obviously a franchise record, and I think what's special about  it is that it's a team accomplishment. We haven't had one or two guys  win these games for us.&quot;<br /> <br />Los  Angeles needed just two shootout victories to establish this mark with  a roster that's only now discovering what it can do. <div style="float:right; width:200px; background-color:pink; padding:9px;">We have a lot of confidence  right now, and we know that if we stick to our game, most nights we  will be successful,&quot; said Handzus.</div>After a midseason  swoon that dropped them from first place in the Western Conference to  the middle of the pack, the Kings have moved back up to third with  their 11th victory in 12 games. Although coach Terry Murray nearly  pulled Quick after the first period, he instead shuffled his lines and  stuck with his workhorse goalie following a players-only meeting. The  U.S. Olympian responded with flawless work in his 12th straight  appearance, moving within one win of the franchise's single-season  victories record. Hanzus also had an assist to give him six points in the last two games. &quot;We knew we didn't play well in the  first period. ... We decided not to try and hit a home run. We just  wanted to try and score the first goal and go from there. It's great,  and a great comeback for us.&quot;<br style="clear:both" /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=1486">Alexander Frolov</a>, Handzus and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=876">Ryan Smyth</a> scored in the second period, and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=3634">Jonathan Quick</a> made 20 saves in his NHL-leading 34th victory.
