			<p>GLENDALE, Ariz. — The seconds ticked off late in the fourth quarter Sunday, and how familiar it must have all seemed to Bill Belichick, to Tom Brady, to the New England Patriots and their fans wondering why, oh why, was this happening again.</p>

<p>In their last two Super Bowls, the Patriots had lost in improbable fashion, last-minute defeats fueled by ridiculous passes and absurd catches, and now came the Seattle Seahawks, driving to the New England 1-yard line.</p>

<p>In a frantic finish, and after a dose of karmic payback, the Patriots survived. It was New England that became a team for the ages, not Seattle, winning its fourth Super Bowl title, 28-24, when Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson’s pass in the end zone with 26 seconds remaining.</p>

<p>"We've had some great teams that haven't won it and I think you've got to just enjoy the moment," Brady said. "We've been on the other end of this twice now."</p>

<p>Butler’s catch had the same nauseating effect on the Seahawks and their supporters as David Tyree’s helmet catch here seven years ago or Mario Manningham’s sideline grab three years ago did on the Patriots, who lost those Super Bowls to the Giants by a total of 7 points.</p>

<p>It spoiled the Seahawks’ repeat bid, denying them of dynasty status, and returned one of the league’s most successful franchises to glory. And it came on a play call whose merits will be debated in barrooms and boardrooms in the Pacific Northwest for years to come.</p>
