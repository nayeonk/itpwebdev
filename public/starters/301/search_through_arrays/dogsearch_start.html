<script>

// Below "starter" code in the function sets up a blank/clear variable (newhtml).

// Then it loops through all images and for each record/row in the array adds one image tag to the variable. So when it is done it has built a variable that contains a bunch of img tags.

// Then it takes the contents of the div IDed as contentbox and sets its content (innerHTML) to that code... basically wiping the current content of the div and adding to newly built series of HTML img tags to it.

// So what we wat to do is, inside the loop, add a conditional cluase that checks if the search term is contained (indexOf) inside the imgdescr array... and if so only THEN adds an image tag for the corresponding image to the newhtml code.
