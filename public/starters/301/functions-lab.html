// this function has three parameters, meaning when it is called 3 pieces of information should be passed to it
// the three arguments passed to it will be the width, height, and border that the image should be scaled to

// you should have three lines in this function.
// each line will set a new style property for the image: width, height and border

// the name of the object is static (i.e. there is only one image on the page, so you can use that imagename as part of your calls)
