Project Requirements
====================

Due date: December 6th 10am
Late deadline: December 13th, 2pm
Project presentations will be on the day of the final: December 13	2-4 p.m.

Final projects should be linked in your student space on ITP300. 

### Late Deadline 

The late deadline for projects is the day of the presentation (final exam day). If you turn in your project at that time (rather than the due date) you will receive 94% credit. If you are going to take advantage of the late deadline you MUST send an e-mail to the instructor and grader by the due date letting us know (that you are opting for the late deadline)... otherwise your project (whatever its status) will be graded as-is.  

### Requirements

* Original database, designed by you, that has been populated with appropriate data to your site 
* Site content (graphics, narative text, etc.) beyond the db content. 
* General design that is consistent across site and sections
 
Either a relatively complex database OR a more simplistic database in which data is used in a relatively complex way. This means that there should be a decent level of complexity in your schema, SQL, or php use of the data, if not two or all three. 
 
Administrative sub-sites. All class projects should have administrative interfaces to edit and add to the data in the db. It would be best if you could edit EVERYTHING in your db (including the data from look-up tables, such as adding new look-up options) but at the very least, core data should be editable. 
 
Basic security. Pretty much all sites will have some functions (such as complete administrative/db access) that not everyone should be allowed to have. You can implement "simple" security (one password), or even better create separate accounts (usernames and passwords) for different users. A higher level of security would have actual security levels for different people, which would allow them to perform different operations on your site. 
 
### Extras 

Other features you can add which are good additions to projects -- you are expected to have at a MINIMUM at least one of the below:

* File uploads
* Meaningful email generation
* Integrated/substituted graphics for data
* Advanced security (security levels based on users/user accounts)
* Charts and graphics of numberic data
* Advanced sql (such as aggregate sql or groupings)
* Advanced php
