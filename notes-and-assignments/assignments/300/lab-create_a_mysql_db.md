Create a MySQL Database
=======================

First off, log into the phpMyAdmin: http://itp300.usc.edu/phpmyadmin using your username and password.

If this is your first time logging into the MySQL server your initial password is "usctrojan2013" for Yuanbo's class and "ttrojan" for David's class.

__Note: Even though it has the same username as your remote server, the MySQL user account IS separate... but you can set the passwords to the same one you use on your main USC account for convenience. However, I recommend setting your password to something other than your USC pw (but something you can still easily remember).__

Ok, logged in? Find the database under your name. Click on it. Notice it has no tables? 

For this lab you will create a 3-4 table database on ANY topic inside MySQL. Using your database space you will create tables with their own fields (and keys). 

### Requirements

* Minimum of 3 tables, all with keys whose names should indicate relationships.
* Every table should have at least a primary key, if not a primary key + foreign key/s
* __Note: You will NOT be enforcing those relationships in the DB itself (no relationship screen) but later through your SQL statements(ID = ID)__
* Use appropriate data types for each field. You can pretty much stick with int, datetime, varchar(#), and text (with no length).

The database can be on any topic you want. You could build out part of your project database, you could a random product database (t-shirts, CDs), etc. 

Each table should have at least a couple of records (as sample data). 

When you are finished, list the lab on your assignment page. You don't need a link, but should list out the tables (i.e. "album, artist, song").
