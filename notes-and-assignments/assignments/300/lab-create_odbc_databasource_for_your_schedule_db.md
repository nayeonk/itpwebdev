Lab -- Create ODBC datasource for your schedule DB
====

_Rename your classdb and have the instructor create an odbc connection to your schedule database_

First, rename your "class schedule database" to NAME\_schedule.mdb using your email prefix. So for instance mine would be "dent_schedule.mdb". Then verify/relink the schedule database from your ITP300 classpage. 

Then get together with the instructor (in lab or through email) and have him create a datasource for you for that database. Your new odbc datasource will be name by your name and "schedule", so for instance mine would be "dentschedule". 

How can you test that it worked? Go to the page below and try typing in an odbc datasource name. The datasource "dvd" is already created, for instance:
