Final projects are due (linked in your student space on ITP300) by the end of lab on the Friday they are due. 

There are some minimums that all projects should share:
* Original database, designed by you, that has been populated with appropriate data to your site 
 
* Site content (graphics, narative text, etd.) beyond the db content. 
 
* General design that is consistent across site and sections. 
 
* Either a relateively complex database OR a more simplistic database who data is used in relatively complex ways (or is surveyed through relatively complex ways). This means that there should be a decent level of complexity in your schema, SQL or php use of the data, if not two or all three. 
 
* Administrative sub-sites. All class projects should have administrative interfaces to edit and add to the data in the db. It would be best if you could edit EVERYTHING in your db (including the data from look-up tables, such as adding new look-up options), but at the very least CERTAIN users should be able to edit all core data. 
 
* Basic security. Pretty much all sites will have some functions (such as complete administrative/db access) that not everyone should be allowed to have. You can implement "simple" security (one password), or even better create separate accounts (names and passes) for different users. A higher level of security would have actual security levels for different people, which would allow them to do different things on your site. 
 
* Extras: Other features you can add which are good additions to projects -- you are expected to have at a MINIMUM at least one of the below:
	* File uploads
	* Meaningful email generation
	* Integrated/substituted graphics for data
	* Advanced security (security levels based on users/user accounts)
	* Charts and graphics of numberic data
	* Advanced sql and php (aggregate sql, inner groupings through cfoutput, etc.)

	Project presentations (for both sections combined) will be on Wednesday, Dec. 12 at 2 p.m. in KAP160 (note room nubmer). 
	
	
## Late Deadline  

The late deadline for ITP300 projects is 1 p.m. on Wed, Dec. 11. If you turn in your project at that time \(rather than on Friday, December 6\).  

__You will receive 94% credit. If you are going to take advantage of the late deadline you MUST send an e-mail to the instructor and grader by Dec 6 letting us know \(that you are opting for the late deadline\)\.\.\. otherwise your project \(whatever its status\) will be graded as-is after Dec 11.__
