Project Proposal & Schema
=================

Write out a proposal for your individual site project. This should describe (in about one written page) the scope of your site, how it will be dynamic and use a database, etc. Your proposal should be turned in as an HTML webpage posted to your classpage. 

You also must complete an initial schema of the database you will be using. You can either design the database and draw the schema on paper, or actually draft the database... but please note that you must POST the schema (scan a drawing, screenshot, etc.) to your proposal page because we will be looking at and discussing your schema and sites in class. 

__Your project databases can be in either Access or MySQL.__ 

As will be discussed in class, Access is easy to build a database but more awkward to access through PHP.

So you need to post both the written proposal AND the schema to a web page in your class space (and linked off your class page).
