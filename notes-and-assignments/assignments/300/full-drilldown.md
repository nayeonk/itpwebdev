You can use pages from any of your previous assignments. 

Create a workflow for an administration module for the DVD Movies such that the user:  

1. Sets up search criteria
2. Gets a results page that has __brief__ information on each title. Each title has links (for that title to):

 2. Edit
 3. Delete
