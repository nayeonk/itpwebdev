For the initial build of your database it must have at least 5 tables (including look-ups), actual data in all tables, and at least one core view.

You can (and probably will) develop the database more -- probably edit the structure and definitely add more data. But this is an initial build deadline to force you to create at least an intial build.

This build can be in either mySql or Access... BUT... we aware that your final database (in your project) must be in mySql.

Note: For those who want to develop your initial build in Access I am working with our IT staff to get some conversion tools into vlab. The TAs and instructor can help you with any Access-to-mySql conversions, but if you chose to do your initial db build in Access you need to be prepared to put extra time into the mySql conversion after this build.
