Late Deadline: 

The late deadline for the Major Project for ITP300 is 1 p.m. on Wednesday, December 12th (before the presentations). If you turn in your project at that time (rather than on Friday, December 7) you will receive 94% credit. If you are going to take advantage of the late deadline you MUST send an e-mail to the instructor and grader by Dec 7 letting them know (that you are opting for the late deadline)... otherwise your project (whatever its status) will be graded as-is after Dec 7.
