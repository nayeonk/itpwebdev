Lab - create classpage and wwwroot directory in vlab
===============
1. Log into remote lab
2. Create directory wwwroot under Documents/MyDocuments
3. Create classpage.php
4. In a browser go to your webdev site. Click on the "test" link above your picture. You should see an empty directory.

Now log into the remote labs. See instructions/resource post for help.

Go back to the classpage and the test link/directory. You should now see a bunch of directories like Documents, Downloads, etc.

In the virtual lab, go to your drive (U?). In that drive go into Documents/MyDocuments. Inside THAT folder create a new directory names wwwroot.

In wwwroot create a new page named "classpage.php" (note *NOT* .html).

Now go back to the course frontpage on webdev. For your entry click on the **SECOND** link labelled classpage. That should bring up the page you just created.

Finally, go back to classpage.php and:
* Put your name and email and section ITP300M, ITP300W) at the top.
* Create a column on the page named Labs and Assignments
