Lab - Hockey db: Create a hockey schedule database
===============

*First you need to be able to log into the remote lab for ITP300 server using RDC. You should complete the classpage "lab" before trying to post your completed database assignment.*

Create a database in Access that contains the following information. If you create the database in the virtual lab save it to the "u:\" drive either in documents or in "documents/wwwroot."

You will need to follow fundamental database rules such as including primary and foreign keys and __NORMALIZING__ the data to avoid repetition. This will mean creating at least three tables for this assignment.

Different fields will have different data types. Take a stab at trying to figure them out yourself. 

Once you have designed the database, you will need to populate it with the data below. 

You do NOT have to design any forms or reports in Access to display the data. Just create the tables with their fields, establish the relationships between fields in tables, and enter the data into the tables. 

*Tip1: Some might be tempted to put both the teams and opponents in the same table. It will become clear later in the course, but for now resist that temptation.*

*Tip2: Although it might seem kind of backward, you will actually need to populate your "look up" tables before you fill out the information in your primary table. I.e. before you can enter a reference to a particular rink in the main table, you will have had to populate the rink table with rinks.*

The completed database should be saved in the virtual lab (or copied there if you completed it on a local computer). It should be saved in your My Documents folder (or in the sub-folder wwwroot).
