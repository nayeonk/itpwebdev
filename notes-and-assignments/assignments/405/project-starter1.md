Project Starter 1
=================

Figure out what API you'd like to use in your application. Write a class that interacts with that API. Then, build a class similar to the example in class where it is responsible for:

1. Checking if data is in the cache, and if so returns that.
2. If data in the cache is stale or doesnt exist, it refetches data, caches it, and returns that data.

If you plan on using Node.js for the project, please document in a readme.md file the caching package you will be using.
