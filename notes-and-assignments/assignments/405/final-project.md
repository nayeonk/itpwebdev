Final Project
=============

Create a final project on a topic of your choice using the technologies and techniques covered in this course

### Requirements

* Use of the Laravel framework or Node.js (Express)
* Adheres to the MVC pattern
	* Use of controllers to group related actions 
* At least 1 API call
* Caching
* Original MySQL database designed by you that has been populated with appropriate data for
your application. You should have at least 3 tables. I will need to set up a mysql db for you unless you want to set up MySQL locally and then I can migrate it over to the remote server when you are finished.
* __Secure__ database reading/writing (escaping of user input). If you are using Laravel, this is handled for you if you use the query builder or the ORM.
* Authenticated set of pages. I should be able to perform administrative actions in your authenticated admin section. You must have a user account of 'david' with a password of 'laravel'. Administrative actions may include any number of the following: adding new data, deleting data, editing data, creating new users, etc.
* Flash messaging 
* Blade layouts if you are using Laravel
* At least 4 unit tests
* Server-side data validation
* Site content (graphics, narrative text, etc.) beyond the database content
* General design that is consistent across site and sections 
* Easy to use & styling

### Submission

* Final projects will be turned in on Github and Heroku
* Final projects may be turned in late by 1 week for 94% credit. You must notify the instructor if you opt for the later deadline before the due date.
* Students will create a short (less than 5 minute) screencast walking through and explaining their project and where requirements were met. This gives you a chance to demonstrate all aspects of your application that I might miss when grading. Here are a few free screencast options:
	* http://www.screenr.com/ (in the browser)
	* quicktime on mac
	* Jing - http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html

### Grading

I will grade based on the above requirements as well as:

* application complexity and organization
* styling / html document structure (as opposed to pages not having an HTML document structure)
* does it work?

__Final project presentations will take place on the last day of class__
