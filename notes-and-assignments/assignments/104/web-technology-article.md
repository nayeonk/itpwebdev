Web page on one technology/trend
================================

This assignment is made up of two components:

1. Writing an original, short (no more than two pages) paper/artcle on one web technology or trend
2. Creating an "article" web page that features your writing as well as links and graphics/photos/screenshots from the web

### The article/paper

Pick a major Web technology or movements such as Database Web Development, Interactive Scripting, an area of Social Networks (not just Facebook in general), content abstractions, etc. Perform some research into its nature and importance. Then write an original shortish paper/article (2 pages) that highlights:

* Basic description
* How it relates to or has changes the basic Web publishing paradigm
* Some in-depth examples of its implementation including site names, URL and relevancy

For this assignment, you CAN work in small groups (2-3 people) if you choose to. Group projects should clearly list all involved students. Also projects written by groups will be expected to have more expansive scopes (more pages), degree of detail, etc., than individual ones.

 
### Article web page

Second, design and publish a web page for your "trend article". This page should contain:

* The text of your article
* A sidebar or navigation that contains working hyperlinks to examples of sites/pages from the web (both research sources and examples)
* Graphics, photos and/or screenshots of examples from the web that are integrated into the article page.

In terms of layout and design, you are welcome to use Dreamweaver and even its pre-built "page layouts" for this project. Note: If you DO use a DW pag layout you MUST change the base color scheme of the page.
