Create your own Logo
====================

Using the basic photoshop knowledge you have learned, create your own logo that you will be using for the final project.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
* Includes the name/title of your final project website in some way (can be an abbreviation - e.g. Michael Kors uses MK on their logo)
* Use at least two colors in some way

**DELIVERY:**
* Save out the finished product as a JPG or PNG.
* Create a new HTML page. Insert your logo inside this HTML page. Make sure you insert the JPG or PNG version of your logo. NOT the .psd file. PSD files will NOT show up a website.
* Upload this HTML page with your logo to the USC web server via FileZilla.
* Go back to your classpage and add a link to this HTML page with your logo.
