Survey
======

For this assignment you are going to build a survey on a topic of your choice. It does **NOT** need to be functional (does not need to actually submit anywhere). 

**REQUIREMENTS: **
* The survey must be about a particular topic. The questions asked must fit the survey's topic. 
* Must pick a color scheme that works well.
* Have a clean look -- with all of the labels (name, age, email, etc) in one column and the form fields (text input, checkbox, etc) in another column
* Must use all of the major form objects (at least one of each):
	* Text inputs 
	* Radio Buttons 
	* Checkboxes 
	* Textareas 
	* Select Menu 
	* Submit button
* Must have a Reset button that resets the form
* Optional: Can use the USC form script to send the survey contents to your email address
