Survey
======

For this assignment you are going to build a survey on a topic of your choice. It does **NOT** need to be functional (does not need to actually submit anywhere). 

**REQUIREMENTS: **
1. The survey must be about a particular topic. The questions asked must fit the survey's topic. 
2. Must pick a color scheme that works well.
3. Have a clean look -- with all of the labels (name, age, email, etc) in one column and the form fields (text input, checkbox, etc) in another column
4. Must use all of the major form objects (at least one of each):
	* Text inputs 
	* Radio Buttons 
	* Checkboxes 
	* Textareas 
	* Select Menu 
	* Submit button
5. Must have a Reset button that resets the form
6. Optional: Can use the USC form script to send the survey contents to your email address
