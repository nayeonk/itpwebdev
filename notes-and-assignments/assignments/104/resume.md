Resume
======

Your first official assignment (not lab) is to create an "online resume" web page. You will use actual information about yourself, include images on the page, and use styles to format your text. The resume will have a top header, followed by education, experience and skills sections.

You might also find it useful to use the unordered list (ul) and list item (li) tags if you want to create "bulleted" items, but it is not required. If not, you can also use paragraphs or divs.

**REQUIREMENTS**

1. A background color or a background image for the entire resume.
2. Include a `<style>` block in your page and use at least one CSS selector to style an element in your resume.
3. Use `<div>` to wrap each section of your resume. Sections for your resume would be:
    * **Header** - This is where your main contact information should be located. This section should:
        * be positioned at the top center-ish of your resume
        * include your name, email address, and phone number, and a photo of yourself (you do not have to use your real information)
        * have your name be formatted significantly differnet from the other items
        * have your image at the very left or right of your resume by using CSS float
    * **Education** - This section should include:
        * a heading that reads 'Education'
        * your high school and college education information below the heading
        * at least one image that fits with the contents of this heading below or to the side of this section
    * **Experience** - This section should include:
        * a heading that reads 'Experience'
        * at least 3 previous work experience with standard information such as job title, employer, time span, etc below the heading
        * at least one image that fits with the contents of this heading below or to the side of this section
    * **Skills** - This section should include:
        * a heading that reads 'Skills'
        * at least 3 skills below the heading
        * at least one image that fits with the contents of this heading below or to the side of this section
4. A line separating the header section from the rest of your resume.
