Web Technology Deconstruction
=============================

Pick one of your favorite sites or web-based applications (like gmail). Perform some research on the technologies used for your favorite site. This could be looking at the page source and Googling around. Based on the web technologies discussed in class and your own research, write up roughly 3 paragraphs in a web page discussing the technologies used for a site AND how you think they might be used. Give examples on how a technology might be used. For example, if I were discussing Amazon, I could talk about how there is some database that stores all product information for books, movies, music, etc. Then I could discuss how this product information is flowed into an HTML page template.

Please don't use Amazon for this writeup since it was discussed in class. When you are finished, post this web page to your classpage.
