Calendar
========

Using divs, create a web page that is a graphic calendar of a month of your choosing.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

* The overall calendar must have a set width.
* The background color (behind the calendar) of the entire page must be unique (not white).
* The overall calendar must be **at the center of your browser**.
* At the very top of the calendar, there must be an image that represents the month of your choosing.
* The name of the month and year of the calendar must be on top of or right below the month image.
* Below the month and year, there must be one row of seven columns that indicates the seven weekdays. 
* Below the weekdays, there must be seven columns on each row that indicates each day of the week.
* All of the days of the month should have uniform sizes and should be relatively square.
* Select **three** special event or holidays that occur during the month. Each of these days MUST:
    * list the name of that day (e.g. Nayeon's Birthday, Thanksgiving, etc)
    * feature a unique background color
    * have a small graphic in the cell for that day
* Styles: You can still use inline styles (directly in the div or other html tag), but you must use at least ONE class that is defined within the stylesheet (<style></style> tag). One obvious place a class can be used is for divs that contain the days of the month. The naming of the class is completely up to you, but it is recommended to use a name that clearly defines what this class is (e.g. ".day" or ".date").
