Calendar
========

Using divs, create a web page that is a graphic calendar of a month of your choosing.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. The overall calendar must have a set width.
2. The calendar's background color must be different from the rest of the page.
3. The overall calendar must be **at the center of your browser**.
4. At the very top of the calendar, there must be an image that represents the month of your choosing.
5. The name of the month and year of the calendar must be on top of or right below the month image.
6. Below the month and year, there must be one row of seven columns that indicates the seven weekdays. 
7. Below the weekdays, there must be seven columns on each row that indicates each day of the week.
8. All of the days of the month should have uniform sizes and should be relatively square.
9. Select **three** special event or holidays that occur during the month. Each of these days MUST:
    * list the name of that day (e.g. Nayeon's Birthday, Thanksgiving, etc)
    * feature a unique background color
    * have a small graphic in the cell for that day
10. Styles: You can still use inline styles (directly in the div or other html tag), but you must use at least ONE class that is defined within the stylesheet (<style></style> tag). One obvious place a class can be used is for divs that contain the days of the month. The naming of the class is completely up to you, but it is recommended to use a name that clearly defines what this class is (e.g. ".day" or ".date").
