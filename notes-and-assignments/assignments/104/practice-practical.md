Practice Practical Exam
=======================

Below are two previous practical Exams. The goal of the practical exam is to re-create the given image using HTML and CSS as close as you can. You will be given the images and text that goes along. To practice, pick ** at least one** version and try to implement it. Submit it before the time of the exam to get lab credit.

**Suggested approach:**
1. Start by saving all of the assets (images and text needed for the web page) into a new folder on your computer, such as "practical_midterm."
2. Create a new file called "index.html" in that same folder. Now you can begin working on the page.
3. Make a quick sketch of the general structure of the page before starting to code. Note what divs you would want to create for each section of the page.
4. Code the general sections first then go back to fill in the details.

**Important Notes:**
* Try to pay attention to details such as spacing and alignment. Do NOT worry about specific line breaks (at what word a paragraph starts a new line in the middle of paragraph), but you whould duplicate other formatting (text appearance, breaks between paragarphs, background color regions, etc)
* Assume the outercontainer is 800 pixels wide. 
* Use CSS styles through inline styles (inside a tag), through a stylesheet, or a combination of both.
* Try to finish as much of the exam as possible. There are some parts of the practical that are more difficult than others, so if you get stuck try to complete the easier or more general parts -- do the basic layout, style formatting, etc. -- and then come back to the harder parts. 
* Remember that no Internet or notes are allowed for this exam, so I would recommend working on this practice exam without notes and see how far you can get.
