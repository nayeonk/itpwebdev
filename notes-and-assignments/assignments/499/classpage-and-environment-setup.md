### 1. Create a classpage

Create a classpage.html file and upload it to aludra.usc.edu in a folder called _itp499_.  This page should have your name, email address, and possibly a contact phone number. Verify that you can click on your name on the class home page and it takes you to this page. This is where you will post links to your assignments. Each assignment will have its own github repository and this is the link you will post on your classpage.
