Final Project
=============

Create a final project on a topic of your choice using the technologies and techniques covered in this course

### Requirements

* Use of the Laravel 4 framework 
* At least 1 API call
* Original database designed by you that has been populated with appropriate data for
your application. You should have at least 3 tables. I will need to set up a mysql db for you unless you want to set up MySQL locally and then I can migrate it over to the remote server when you are finished.
* Database reading/writing using either the query builder or the ORM
* Authenticated set of pages. You can roll your own authentication system similar to the authentication homework using Symfony components and/or Laravel components (like the session class) or make use of Laravel's Auth class. I should be able to edit most of your core data in your database in your authenticated section. You must have a user account of 'david' with a password of 'laravel'.
* Use of controllers to group related actions 
* Application structure for classes that donâ€™t fit within Models or Controllers and use of 
namespacing and composer psr-0 autoloading
* At least 2 unit / integration tests using PHPUnit
* Site content (graphics, narrative text, etc.) beyond the database content
* General design that is consistent across site and sections 
* Easy to use 

### Extras

You must use at least 1 project extra

* Use of Laravel's Cache class. For example, you might want to cache API calls
* Laravel's templating engine, Blade
* IoC container usage
* Node.js integration with Laravel
* additional API calls

### Submission

* Final projects will be turned in on Github
* Final projects may be turned in late by 1 week for 94% credit. You must notify the instructor if you opt for the later deadline before the due date.
* Students will create a short (less than 5 minute) screencast walking through and explaining their project and where requirements were met. This gives you a chance to demonstrate all aspects of your application that I might miss when grading. Here are a few free screencast options:
	* http://www.screenr.com/ (in the browser)
	* quicktime on mac
	* Jing - http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html

### Grading

I will grade based on:

* database, sql (through ORM or query builder queries), and application complexity
* application architecture (i.e. you made use of MVC and created extra classes for components that dont fit within MVC)
* styling / html document structure (as opposed to using HTML without a HTML document structure)
* use of extra(s) - at least 1
* easy to navigate and use
* site content


__Final project presentations will take place during lab on the last day of class__
