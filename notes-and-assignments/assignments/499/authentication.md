Authentication
==============

### Overview

You will be creating an authentication module where users can login to an administrative dashboard. In this homework, you will use Composer to leverage 2 popular PHP packages:

* Symfony's HttpFoundation Components to interact with:
	* request data
	* sessions
	* responses (redirects)
* Carbon for date formatting on the Dashboard page

You will __NOT__ be accessing PHP superglobal data using $_GET, $_POST, or $_SESSION. You will instead use Symfony's HttpFoundation.

You will create 4 pages:

* login.php
* login-process.php
* dashboard.php
* logout.php

When a user logs in, the credentials will be compared against the users table in the __music__ database. There are a few accounts in there for you to work with. The password is _laravel_ for all accounts and it is encrypted using the MySQL SHA1() function.

Lastly, you should using the autoloader generated by Composer to autoload any components and custom classes that you create.

### login.php

Create a form with username and password inputs. It will submit to login-process.php.

### login-process.php

This page is responsible for processing a login request. The process should go like this:

```
if no username or password from the request, redirect back to login page
	check if user exists in the database for the given credentils
		yes
			create a session storing _username_ and _loggedInAt_ (which is a timestamp)
			create a 'success' flash message to be displayed on the dashboard "You have successfully logged in!"
			redirect to dashboard.php and display flash message
		no
			redirect to login.php with an error flash message stating "Incorrect credentials"
```

### dashboard.php

The dashboard is a page that only authenticated users can access. If I navigate directly to this page and I am not logged in, I should be redirected to login.php.

Display a table of all songs containing

* title
* artist
* genre
* price

### logout.php

This should clear the session and redirect to login.php.

### Other Requirements

* on every page, there should be a check to see if the user is logged in. if so, redirect to dashboard.php
* you must use Carbon to display the date on the dashboard
* There should only be 1 database connection per request. Create a file called db.php like in previous assignment and use that same connection across pages
* Classes should be in their own file and namespaced properly to follow psr-0 autoloading standard.
* Make these pages presentable where it is easy for me to use and read (data should be organized on the screen with plenty of white space and separators).

### Submission

To submit, push this code up to the __same repository__ with a folder called PHP-Auth-A3 and email the repository URL to itpwebdev@gmail.com
