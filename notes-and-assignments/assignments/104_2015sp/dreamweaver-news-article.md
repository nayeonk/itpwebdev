Convert a news article
======================

Go to a news site and pick an article. Save the text, a couple of pictures from the article, and the logo/masthead of the site.

Now re-lay out a new page in Dreamweaver for the article with a DIFFERENT layout (that what was on the original page). You can use the DW "layouts" if you want. Either start a blank page with New > Blank Page > HTML > None or New > Blank Page > HTML > and pick a layout like 2 columns fixed, left sidebar, header, footer. Just whatever you do make sure when you create a new page in DW that you pick Blank Page > HTML.

__Do NOT pick HTML Template.__

Lay out the article and its graphics in your new page. Have spaces in your layout for a site logo and navigation.

Your final page should have a partial navigation, a name/logo for the site, as well as the article and its text and images.

Once the article is laid out go into your new layout and edit the css for the page so that the page has the general color scheme of the original news site.

Finally at the top or bottom of your new page add a link to the original article (from the original site).
