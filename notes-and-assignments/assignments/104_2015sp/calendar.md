Calendar
========

Using divs, create a web page that is a graphic calendar of your birth month.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

* The overall calendar should have a set width, and there should be a unique background color for the whole calendar
* Across the top of the calendar you should have a graphic in the background, with the name of the month and the year __on top of it__. This can be done through a background image in css and text in the cell. The text can be on "top" of the graphic, or to the side. You can also simply have a graphic on top of the month. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can create a graphic that has the month+year on top of an image. __Note: We will be starting graphic creation in two weeks. So a self-created image is optional__.
	* This div must have a unique background color
* In the body of the calendar, which should have seven columns (for each day of the week). There should be one "header" row that lists the days of the month (at the top of each column).
* Each 'day' of the calendar should have the number representing that day.
* You need to select THREE special event or holiday days in your calendar. Your birthday should be one, plus two others. Each of these days MUST:
	* list the name/title of that day ("Patrick's birthday", "Thanksgiving", etc.)
	* feature a unique background color
	* have a small graphic in the cell for that day
* All of the days of the month should uniform sizes and should be relatively square.
* Styles: The CSS properties of main calendar box can be coded inline (directly its div tag), BUT the standard properties for the "day" boxes must be defined by creating a "class". It can be named ".day" or ".daystyle," etc. Naming is up to you but it is recommended to use a name that clearly defines what this class is.
