jQuery Cycle Plugin
===================

Create a webpage that has a slideshow using the [jQuery Cycle 2 plugin](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/).

1. Download 4 images from google images that are roughly the same topic
2. Resize your images to roughly 600 x 400 using Photoshop
3. Implement the jQuery cycle 2 plugin to add a slideshow to your webpage that uses your images

Note: You cannot use the images provided by the plugin examples. You must download your own.

Tip: Before you start, create a folder called 'jquery-cycle-lab', and place everything related to this lab inside of that folder.
