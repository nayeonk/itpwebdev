Project Homepage
================

This assignment is to create an initial homepage for your semester web site. 

This should include a main graphic you create to represent the topic/idea of your project, some text describing the project (in other words an introduction), and an initial navigation for the site.
  
Navigations should reflect the site structure and organization of the individual pages; although the individual sections of your site are of course not completed. It would be best if you created 'dummy' fronts so that the navs go somewhere, but your nav buttons __do__ need to have links (anchor tags) on them.

Although your initial navigations may change (exact wording, graphics, styling, etc.), the navigation should convey the thematic and aesthetic approach you intend for your final navigation (and site). 
  


**REQUIREMENTS:**

* __Real content:__ Not just placeholder text. Of course you will change, edit, add to, etc., the frontpage text. But a frontpage is more than just a title graphic and a nav. Well in most cases.

* __Major title graphic:__ Should integrate at least one image or illustration as well as the title of your site. Fairly large in size (not just a small button) and prominantly placed.

* __Navigation:__ Navigation items with the real text referring to sections/pages of your site. They should be hyperlinked to pages. Although it is best if you create dummy pages (about.html, sports.html, etc.) it is nevertheless not required. But the navs do need to have links (even if they go to "Page not found").

* __General design:__ The page should have a fairly unified style, look, color scheme, etc. Your site might have a consistent 2 column layout where the sidebar contains tweets or navigation items etc and all pages would have this 2 column layout. Sometimes inner pages of a web site have different layouts than the front (think of how different the frontpage "headline" of a news site is to article pages). In either approach, the general look, feel, color scheme, etc., should be laid out and consistent.


**DELIVERY:**

My recommendation is to create a new folder inside your itp104 folder on the web server to keep all your final project files. So for example, if I call my folder "project," I can reach it by going to www-scf.usc.edu/~USERNAME/itp104/project. Upload your homepage HTML and all graphics to that folder and link your HTML file on your classpage, as usual.

**SAMPLES**

*Please note the examples below are FINAL fronts (what the students completed at the end of the semester) but they give you an idea of title and navigation graphics/buttons. Also note that most frontpages have introductory text for the site even though two of the examples below do not.*
