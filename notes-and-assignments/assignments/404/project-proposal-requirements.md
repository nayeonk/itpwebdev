Project Proposal
================

1. Describe your project in a few sentences
2. Describe the APIs you'd like to use and what some of the endpoints are. Specify if you will be using JSONP or a server-side technology to access the web service. If you know another backend language, you are welcome to use it instead of PHP but you'll have to host it and give me a link for grading
3. Draw up a quick wireframe
4. Will this be more of a JS single-page application or a multi-page application/site?

You might want to look at the syllabus of topics that we haven't covered and see if any of that material might be something interesting that you'd like to incorporate. 

### Backends as a Service

Many web applications require some type of data persistence layer. Many times this is your own backend written in some server-side technology (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc) with your own database (MySQL, SQL Server Postgres, MongoDB, etc). Because this class doesnt focus on the backend and you might need one, you can look into a new emerging technology model for backends called Backends as a Service (BaaS). In short, BaaS provide a backend for common things like data persistence without you having to build that out yourself. BaaS options include:

1. Parse - https://www.parse.com/
2. Firebase - https://www.firebase.com/

Next week during lab I will go over how to use Parse. This is not mandatory but could be useful if you'd like to use a BaaS in your project.

### Submission

You can submit this assignment either as a hard copy or a digital submission posted to your classpage.
