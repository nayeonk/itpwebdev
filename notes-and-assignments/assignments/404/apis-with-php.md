APIs with PHP
=============

Try taking one of the APIs below and rendering using the 2 following techniques:

1. client side templating - Here you will grab the data from PHP and echo the JSON into a JavaScript variable
2. server side rendering - You will render directly from PHP

You will have 2 different pages that look the same from the user's standpoint, but they were rendered differently.
