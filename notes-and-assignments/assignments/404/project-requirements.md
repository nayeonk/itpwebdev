Project Requirements
====================

Your final project will be a JavaScript heavy web application on a topic of interest to you. You can visit [Programmable Web](http://programmableweb.com) to get different ideas about what types of APIs you'd like to use and how might you integrate them to create a unique experience.

### Requirements

* At least 1 JSONP call or AJAX to PHP call
* One of the following:
	1. Google Maps
	2. [Google Charting API](https://developers.google.com/chart/)
	3. Parse (data storage)
	4. An additional JSONP or AJAX to PHP call
* Use 1 of the following frameworks/approaches:
	1. Angular
	2. Backbone
	3. Plain JS/jQuery with client-side templating via Handlebars
* Use of promises
* At least 5 practical unit tests using Jasmine
* Your project should be styled so that it presents a good user experience and looks organized and professional.
* Code organization and modularity, since we discussed several approaches to writing maintainable, organized code. However, I would rather see a working application than a broken one that attempts to have best practices.
* Overall complexity. It should be more complex than your assignments and midterm project and your APIs should be integrated in some way.

### Project Submission

Your project can be turned in 1 of 2 ways:

1. Hosted on aludra and a link to it is on your classpage
2. Deployed to a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Appfog, Heroku, or Fort Rabbit. This would be if you have features that aludra does not support. Post a link to your hosted project on your class page.

A zip file of all your code or a link to a github repository should be linked to your classpage as well so that I can download it.

Lastly, you will need to provide a link to an HTML page that shows all of your unit tests, succeeding or failing. Take a look at the HTML page setup for the "Building jQuery" assignment: https://bitbucket.org/skaterdav85/building-jquery/src.
