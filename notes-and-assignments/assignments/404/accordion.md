Accordion
=========

Create an accordion similar to [the jQuery UI plugin](http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/). 
Yours will be much simpler than the plugin. Just try and get the basic functionality implemented. 

* Initially only the __first__ content panel is visible and all other content panels are hidden. 
This should be done through JavaScript, not CSS. (Hint: use the .first() or .eq(0) jQuery method)
* When a user clicks on any of the accordion labels, only the content panel that is __next__ to the label you clicked should be made visible.
* _(optional)_ The label for the active content panel should have a class of 'active' applied to it, 
which I have provided a basic style declaration in the styles.css sheet for you.
