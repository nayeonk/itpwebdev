Classpage
=========

Create a _classpage.html_ file with:

* your basic personal information (name, e-mail, and photo of you)
* some miscellaneous graphics
* background color or images
300-pixel table aligned on the left
* file is named classpage.html and residing in your itp301 folder (e.g. http://www-scf.usc.edu/~dtang/itp301/classpage.html)

On your Aludra Web space, first create a directory in your "public_html" (Web) folder called "itp301". Place your classpage.html file with that itp301 directory.

Create 2 columns using either divs or tables.

The left column should contain a "Lab" area where you will list all completed lab exercises for the class, AND will have hyperlinks to the assignments. For instance, for this lab you would write a "Class page" entry with a hyperlink that goes to "classpage.html" (to the same page). 

The right column should contain an "Assignments" area where you will list all completed assignments for the course, including hyperlinks to each completed assignment. 

What all this means is that the instructor and grader should always be able to locate your completed labs and assignments by entering in your Web address using your e-mail prefix. (for instance, http://www-scf.usc.edu/~dtang/itp301/classpage.html ). Because all assignments will be posted, there is no guesswork as to if an assignment is completed and submitted. Of course, the course web site also contains a link to the classpage (that you are creating).

What that ALSO means is that when you THINK you have completed an assignment, MAKE SURE you can reach the final Web pages through your classpage.html, or else in the eyes of your instructor and grader you did not complete the assignment.
