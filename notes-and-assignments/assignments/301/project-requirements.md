Total Points: 300

### 1. Major routine [100 points] 

An original, hand-coded routine that has a fairly significant functionality that is core to a page or section of your web site. It can of course use jQuery but it is expected to have a fairly significant amount of Javascript logic using constucts like loops, arrays, and if statements.
  
### 2. Medium routine 1 [80 points]

An original routine of medium complexity or an adaption of an existing JS/jQuery module that has been significantly customized.

### 3. Medium routine 2 [80 points]

Like above an original routine of medium complexity. You are welcome to base this routine off of your group project, but it should be signicantly modified.

__Your routines should differ significantly from class demos and assignments.__

### 4. Styling & Site Content [40 points]

Style your project so that it is presentable and organized. It should also have sufficient static content such as instructions, introductory content, images, etc. You are welcome to use any CSS libraries like Twitter Bootstrap if you wish.

### Project Summary

Create an HTML file linked from your classpage that summarizes your project and specifies where you met the requirements. This will help identify parts of your project that I might miss or that you want to highlight (such as implementation details).
