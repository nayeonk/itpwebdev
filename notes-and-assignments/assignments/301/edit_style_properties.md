Lab - Edit style properties
============
Write Javascript to edit style properties of IDed DIVs

Save this start page. The first thing you might want to do is open that page in DW so that you can see the 3 layers that are in the page (but have initial visibility properties of "hidden"). 

Using JAVASCRIPT (NOT jQuery) write JS for the first two rows of buttons. Each "change" requires setting a particular style property of a layer (div). 

Use jQuery to scrip the third row of buttons (Sports). 

For the "Toggle" buttons either want to set the visibility to visible or to hidden... but you need to use a conditional clause (if) to first read the current visibility property and then set it to the opposite. 

__Advanced:__ Although not significantly more complex, the most efficient way to write the page is to create Javascript functions to run all of the changes, using parameter variables so that things like move and toggle could be used for any object, and write them in such a way that they can be called both by your JS and your jQuery code.
