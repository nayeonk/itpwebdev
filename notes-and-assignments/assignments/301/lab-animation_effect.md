jQuery Animation Effect
=======================

Using jQuery to add animation to the __mycollege.html__ page.

Download the starter file here [mycollege.html](http://usc.yuanbowang.com/files/lab2/mycollege.html)

__mycollege.html__ contains general info about USC. Using the knowledge we learned in class, create the on click animation effect for each of the sections.

1.  Add jQuery library to the file first.
2.  Hide all the content for each section initially 
3.  Bind a function to the mouseover/click event on the title.
4.  Using 3 different effects to show & change the content of each section
  * To show: using (fadeIn, show, slideDown, etc)
  * To change effect (css, attr, addClass)

Feel Free to change html structures. (Add Tags, IDs or Classes)
