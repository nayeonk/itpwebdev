Simple JavaScript App - Color Setter
====================================

Write a simple JavaScript app that sets the background and foreground colors of a page

This assignments consists of writing a web page change your foreground/(text) or/and background color for "About me" page in your portfolio site.

### Color page

*	Create an "About Me" page with a 2 column layout containing a side bar and a main div. The main div should contain text and images with no less than 3 paragraphs of texts and 2 headlines.
*	In the sidebar, create a 2 column table using an HTML table or divs. The first column should have a header of "Text" and the 2nd column should have a header labeled "Background".
  *	In the "Text" color section, list 10 colors with a radio button in front of each color. I should only be allowed to select 1 radio button from the "Text" column at a time.
  *	In the "Background" color section, list 10 different colors with radio buttons in front of each. I should only be allowed to select 1 radio button from the "Background" column at a time.
  *	Inside each radio button for the colors put an event handler that sets the foreground or background color of the document to the color indicated. _Hint: You will need to write the JavaScript for this directly inside the HTML (radio) tags in the event handlers._

### Advanced (not required)

1. If you want to try something a little more challenging or advanced (NOT REQUIRED OR EXTRA CREDIT), you could try writing a function to do the color changing. 
2. If you want to try something a little more complex (NOT REQUIRED), you could have the main article in a specific DIV, and not change the colors of the document but rather of just one div using getElementById and the .style.backgroundColor and .style.text peroperties.
