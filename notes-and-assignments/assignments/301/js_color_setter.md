### This assignments consists of writing a website app/section change your foreground/(text) or/and background color for "About me" page in your portfolio site.
#### Color page:
*	Create a "About me" page with basic layout and content. You can use text and images. The page should contain no less than 3 paragrahs of texts and 2 headlines. 
*	In the page create a sidebar in a table that says: Set colors and has one cell labeled "Text" and one cell labeled "Background.
  *	In the "Text" color section, list 10 colors with a radio button in front of each color.
  *	In the "Background" color section, list 10 different colors with radio buttons in front of each.
  *	Inside each radio button for the colors put an event handler that sets the foreground or background color of the document to the color indicated. _Hint: You will need to write the JS for this directly inside the html (radio) tags in the event handlers._
  
*	More advanced 1: If you want to try something a little more challenging or advanced (NOT REQUIRED OR EXTRA CREDIT), you could try writing a function to do the color changing. 
 
*	More advanced 2: If you want to try something a little more complex (NOT REQUIRED), you could have the main article in a specific DIV, and not change the colors of the document but rather of just one div using getElementById and the .style.backgroundColor and .style.text peroperties.
