Assignment - Project Proposal: Brainstorming Draft
==========
Written proposal for your semester project.

Write up a proposal for your individual semester web site scripting project. This is a brainstorming draft -- where you are listing out web development components, routines and functionality you want to build, implement, etc., in addition to defining the scope of the project.

To come up with ideas for below... trying going to the Web and look up good (and great) examples of the kind of sit eyou want to do. Then think about re-creating some of the more immersive, interactive, and just plain "cool" parts of the site interface, features, etc.

This is a brainstorming proposal. You are NOT committing to all of the ideas. Some of this will be "pie in the sky". Some of the things I will tell you are much too complicated to do for this project... but maybe we can think of a simpler version you could implement.

And after you turn in your "wishlist" proposal... AFTERWARD I will provide the list of project requirements, and between feedback on your ideas and the list of things you HAVE to do... you can evolve the "actual" feature list.

So for this assignment, your proposal should includea sentence or two on:
*	Graphically rendered/drawn __site/flow chart__ for your project.
*	Section (paragraph) on __Content__ for the site.
*	Section on __Graphics__ for the site.
*	Notes on overall __design__ and __style__ of the site.
*	A Section named __JavaScript/jQuery/Programming__ for the site that describes THREE major apps/routines you will be implement (functionalities, interfaces, etc.):
	*	Routine 1
	*	Routine 2
	*	Routine 3
*	Brief description of some kind of user customization you will implement in the site
*	Explanation of a medium- to high-complexity implementation of DHTML/layers you will use. Adaptable layers, customized layouts, dynamic divs, etc.
*	Some idea of the size/scope of the site, including an approximate __page count__.
