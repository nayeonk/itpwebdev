Final Assignment
=======================
Requirements for final projects


The culmination of the Interactive Web Development course is your major project. As such, your final project should show off not just the content you chose but the skills and techniques you have learned in this class. To that end, the project has fairly general requirements so that you can select areas of Javascript, jQuery, interactivity and dynamic HTML to include. That said, a portion of your project grade will be based on the actual content of your site as well.

All project requirement below should NOT be based on assigments you perfomed for the course. You can take concepts or approaches from lecture demos or labs, but if so obviously your work would be graded on how much you added or coded beyond the core code already provided.

Your project must include __five__ distinct development elements in addition to inherent content. Each of the following requirements will be reflected in your grading:

*	[40 pooints]1. __Customization__: A degree of customization using variables (and possibly cookies). Generally this either is a fairly simple customization that is stored and implemented across all pages, or one page that is highly customizable by the user. An example of the former could be a site that is set up with multiple (different) stylesheets, where the user picks one "look" and their selection (to use that stylesheet over others) is stored and implemented across all pages. An example of the latter would be a page where the user has an interface with many options and after making certain selections the page's content and display is dynamically rendered based on their selections.

*	[70 points]2. __Dynamic layers__: Content areas that either interact with the user in an intermediate way or have pre-scripted behaviors. Examples of this in the past have been layers with content that is custom compiled/built (such as array data and document.write statements), layers whose functionality have a decent degree of interactivity (perhaps drawing on jQuery UI components), layers with scripted behavior based on user activity (more than just simple rollovers), etc.

*	Significant, custom JS/jQuery development: 
	*	[100 points] 3. __Major routine__: An original, hand-coded routine that has a fairly significant functionality that is core to a page or section of your web site. It ca of course use jQuery but it is expected to have a fairly significant amount of Javascript logic (and often also conditional loops).
	*	[70 points] 4. __Medium routine 1__: An original routine of medium complexity or an adaption of an existing JS/jQuery module that has been significantly customized. Note: This cannot be based on a routine your Group implemented for the Group JS assignment.
	*	[70 points] 5. __Medium routine 2__: Like above an original routine of medium complexity OR an adapted routine from an existing library. Note: This cannot be based on a routine you used in your Group JS assignment. If this routine is based on your implementing an existng JS/jQ library or API then you need to have customized or integrated logic into the implementation of their code.

When you complete your major project you must post it to your class Web space (and create a link to it from your assignment page) AND __send an e-mail to the instructor and grader__. This email will list out how you fulfilled EACH of the above requirements, including references to specific pages. This e-mail should be important to you because your write up will not only confirm fulfilling each of the project requirements but lets you advocate for the quality and level of your work -- and how well your project displays your understanding and mastery of the concepts of the course.

#### Your summary e-mail must contain:
*	Subject line of __Final Project summary for ITP301 for <LASTNAME>__
*	Notes on each of your __three routines__, what they are doing, and citations to where the pages/code is for each.
*	Notes on how and where you fulfilled the __dynamic layers__ requirement
*	Note on how/where you implemeted the user __customization__ requirement


Late projects: If you do not turn your project in by the Friday deadline, you can complete it by the time of class presentations for reduced credit. The late deadline is Thursday, May 8th for 96% of normal credit. Note: You MUST email the TA and instructor by end-of-day on Friday, May 3rd if you are going to use the late deadline... otherwise your project will be graded "as is" on 5/2 and marked down for issues you might be working on/fixing if you are taking the late deadline.
