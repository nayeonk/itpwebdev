Group Project
=============

Form a group of 2 to 3 students. Next, choose a JavaScript library/plugin/framework of your choice and learn how to use it. Create a 1-page demo site/application showing how it can be used in a real-world scenario. Your demo-app should be more sophisticated than the "Hello World" sample on the documentation. 

### Presentation

Create a short presentation (roughly 8 minutes) explaining the following:

* the library/plugin you chose to research
* what are its goals?
* a short code sample explaining the objects, methods, paramters, etc and any requirements (like if your HTML has to be set up a certain way, does it require jQuery?, any CSS files needed?)
* A walk-through of your demo-app showing off a practical scenario for this library/plugin/framework

### Libraries / Plugins / Frameworks

Here are just a few libraries you are welcome to check out (but not limited to):

* jQuery UI - You can choose a particular component from here
* Underscore.js
* JS Charts http://www.jscharts.com/how-to-use-pie-charts
* Google Maps Javascript API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
* Google Charts https://developers.google.com/chart/
* Other features of PubNub

Lastly, you can search through the JavaScript Weekly Newsletter archives http://javascriptweekly.com/issues. There are plenty of libraries listed in each issue.
