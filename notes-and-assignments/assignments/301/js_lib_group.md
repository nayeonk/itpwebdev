Assignment --  Group projects: Javascript Libraries
============
Group projects deconstructing and using Javascript routines

Each student must sign up to participate in one Javascript group project. Each project will take a public domain script, use it (in a meaningful way) in a page, figure out how it works, and then __add__ one new functionality.

Each group will demo the working script for the class, as well as deconstructing its operation and use.

Each group will have up to 15 minutes for their presentations. Explaining the working of the script in a meaningful way should take at least 5 or 10 minutes.

Overall, each group is expected to:
*	Take the script and implement it in a meaningful way. In other words you should build a page that has a reason to use the script. You are not expected to spent en exhorbinant amount of time on content for the page, but should make an attempt in that direction.
*	Add to, improve, or otherwise build upon and _beyond_ the core functionality of the module. I.e. add a new functionality or somehow extend its code.
*	Prepare and give a presentation that explains what the code does, deconstucts/explains how the core code works, and breaks down the functionality and code changes the group made to the code.

In working on the group project, each student is expected to contibute. When the project is complete one student will email the instuctor with::
*	URL/link to the implementation/assignment on aludra
*	Listing of each student on the project and __what role__ each student worked under. These can be project management, html/design, code/programming and presentation.

In your presentations:
*	Every member of the group needs to be there but not all need to present. When deciding which students will fulfill which roles/tasks, groups can have everyone take on part of the presentation or have just one or two people be responsible.
*	The presentations should begin with a brief overview of what the script/code does
*	The presenters should give a relatively in-depth deconstruction of what it does and how it works. You should be either going through actual code or showing snippets.
*	The presentation should include a full demonstration of the page you created that uses the script that shows off the functionality as well as highlighting the add-ons or improvements your group made.

In forming the groups student pick which project to sign up. Once all group slots are full and absent students are accounted for students may be placed or moved between groups.
