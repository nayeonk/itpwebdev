jCarousel actor slideshow
============
Implement a slideshow using the jQuery plug-in jCarousel

### Implement jCarousel for "actor slideshow"

For this assignment you will be implementing the jQuery plug-in jCarousel. ___(Note: NOT jCarouselLite)___.

First off, go to the Web and find the documentation and instructions. You will notice the basic set up (ul with li items with images) is similar to jCarouselLite.

Requirements:
*	Collect 12+ images on a particular actor or actress. They should all be still from movies.
*	Build a basic page that explains who the actor is and their major roles. This should be 2 - 3 paragraphs. You can take the info and text from any film sites.
*	Implement jCarousel to have a slideshow of images at the bottom of the page.
*	Customize the page with one or more of the following
	*	Auto-scrolling
	*	Next and previous buttons
	*	Auto-scrolling STOPS if the user uses next or previous buttons
