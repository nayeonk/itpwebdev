CSS Zen Garden
==============

For this you will be developing an original look for the "zen garden" page. You will need to implement some original background images, colors, and graphics. You can base your styles off any existing design.

First off, save the the [zen garden page](http://webdev.usc.edu/itp301/lab_files/zgpage.html) to your computer.

Then create a new file called "style1.css" in the SAME DIRECTORY on your computer. The page will automatically be "hooked up" to that stylesheet. To see if that worked enter a basic style like body { background-color:red } in the style file, save it, then reload the garden page... and the page should have picked up that red color.

Ok, now create an original style for the garden. You are welcome to base your stylesheet off [one of the existing ZG styles](http://csszengarden.com/) (click through the design sidebar) and/or you can look at this [samplecss](http://webdev.usc.edu/itp301/lab_files/samplecss.css).

When you are done with your css design on the garden page, save a COPY of your original css as "style2.css". In that version of the css just make some obvious changes to the design such as changing background colors, float values of sidebars, etc.

At this point, when you load the page the second (style2.css) file should be "controlling" your page. But, if you click on the Style1 and Style2 links in the sidebar that should "switch" between those two (different) styles you created.

This lab is intended to have you play around with stylesheets, review how to flow images and backgrounds into regions, and how to control the location and behavior of divs.

You are welcome to start from an existing Garden design BUT you are expected to be laying an original theme and design. For instance, if you wanted to do a Garfield theme you might save images of the cartoon cat (and perhaps other characters), and then use the primary yellow and orange colors of Garfield to "skin" the garden look and design.

NOTE: The page by default will DISABLE one of the stylesheets when you first load it... so you may need to click on the Style1 and Style2 links (in the sidebar) to see one or the other stylesheet you write.
