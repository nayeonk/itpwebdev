Create a dynamic photo thumbnail page

Build a dynamic page that when the file first loads looks like:

![main photo](http://itpwebdev.herokuapp.com/resources/images_exam.png)


Details:

*	Page contains two layers
*	Top layer has a purple border, blue text, a yellow line and moderate padding.
*	Second layer has black text, a thin black border and high padding
*	You CAN use Dreamweaver to create the layers if you choose.
*	When the page loads, your code should move the layers horizontally (left style property) so that they are exactly centered on the page.
*	When the URL (full web url) is typed into the box and the add button is pressed:
	*	A NEW photo (image) should  be added to the top layer (that contains photos)
	*	Each time a photo is added to the top layer the lower layer should MOVE DOWN on the page by roughly 100 pixels
*	For the exam use the full urls to the dog images. The initial image on the page should be http://webdev.usc.edu/itp301/dogs/dogs05_s.jpg ... to test adding images use any of the 24 dog images.
