Lecture -- Midterm Notes
==============
Notes about midterm and prepping for it.


In preparing for the WRITTEN exam I would suggest:
*	Review the __Study Guide__ to make sure you are familiar with all relevant concepts and functionality we have covered this semester. Any areas that you are unsure of review the original lectures.
*	Be prepared to illustrate your knowledge of Javascript (specifically).
*	Be prepared to illustrate your knowledge of jQuery
*	Reviewing your past assignments, labs, etc. may have some use. The written exam will have some code snippets.
 
In preparing for the PRACTICAL exam I would suggest:
*	Review the __Study Guide__.
*	Review your past assignments, labs and demos/resources.
*	Note that on the practical exam you can use any combination of Javascript and jQuery.
 
### ___Yuanbo's___ Class Written Examination: Tuesday, March 11 from 2:00 - 3:20 p.m. in OHE406

*	Multiple choice, fill-in and simple descriptions:
	```
	To find a character within a string you would use 
	which of the following methods: 
	A) charAt B) indexOf  C) substring  D) findChar  
	E) None of the above
	
	The regular expression that represents all occurrences 
	of commas in a string is:  ___________

	What does an array loop do? (short answer)
	```
	
*	Write a short set of code
	```
	Above are two parallel arrays. 
	Write below the code that would loop through the arrays, 
	pulling out the value from the second array that matches 
	the data from variable "userinput" from the first array.
	```
	
*	Analyze/explain code functionality or theory
	```
	Above is a fairly standard "for" loop. Explain what it is doing.
	```
	
*	Debug
	```
	Find the errors in a supplied line of code.
	```

### ___Yuanbo's___ Practical Examination: Thursday, March 13 from 2:00 - 3:20 p.m. in OHE406

*	Similar to the midterm practice exam, you will be given instructions on building a page that fulfills certain functionalities. You must put together the page to implement the goals of the exam. If applicable you will also be provided a screenshot of what the page will look like.
*	On the Practical Exam you CAN use a combination of Javascript and jQuery. AND you can build the page with Dreamweaver (which has code completion and tips).
*	Like most class assignments, the key is to work through the page requirements step-by-step. It is suggested that you first plan out the routine using JS comments, and then fill in the code/functionality. That way if you run out of time or forget how to do something you can get partial credit for certain routines/functionalities.
*	Even if you are not able to complete the exam (to produce a fully functional page that operates as instructed) you will be given partial credit for all of your work. So make sure you complete as much as possible.
*	To prepare for this exam, review your past labs and assignments and the "Functionality" part of the Study Guide.
*	If it is useful for review and practice, there is an alternate version of the review demo the class built during lecture. Take a look at [start.html](http://webdev.usc.edu/itp301/lecture_examples/layers_watchmen/start.html). Could you solve all of the tasks in the page? There is a completed [demo page with scripting](http://webdev.usc.edu/itp301/lecture_examples/layers_watchmen/working.html) that has examples of much of the interactivity scripting we have done this semester.
