### Fundamental Javascript Concepts

#### Styles

CSS Properties define aspects of objects. When writing in HTML, use style blocks and property names are like "background-color" with declarations such as "width: 200px". When manipulating in JS, property names are like "backgroundColor" and declarations such as "width='200px'". When manipulating with jQuery use .css(). You should already be familiar with CSS and HTML. For the JS and jQuery you can review Editing style properties and the CSS block in Query review and JS

 
#### Objects

Generally created with HTML tags. Often have UNIQUE "id" properties. If you can "locate" an object with Javascript, you can then read a property, write/change a property, or otherwise manipulate it.	 See Intro to programming and JS 
 
#### Variables

Can store (read and write) data such as strings, numbers, objects, functions. See JS variables, expressions and functions.

 
#### Methods

Functionality or "mini-programs" already built into the language. Call/activate them by name. ALWAYS call with parenthesis. Sometimes call "off" an object.

 
#### Functions

"Mini-programs" written by YOU that are called/run by name. Can set up with arguments (so that data is passed INTO them when called). Always define AND call them with parentheses. See JS variables, expressions and functions.

 
#### If Statements / Conditional logic

Write a condition/expression that if "true" the following set of code is run. Can have else if and else clauses. See Conditional logic.

 
#### Arrays

More complex type of variable that can store multiple rows of data (rather than just one piece). Created by a command such as "var favcolors = new Array". See the Array portion of Arrays, dyanmic documents.

 
#### Dynamic Documents

Combining methods such as document.write() with stored data such as in arrays, generate custom blocks of HTML with Javascript. See the dynamic documents portion of Arrays, dynamic documents.

 
#### For Loops 

Loop/repeat a set of code based on defined conditions. See the Loops portion of Loops, charAt, substring, replace.

 
#### Data Validation

Use methods such as indexOf() to determine if data matches desired content and/or formats. See indexOf, data validation.

 
#### Data Transformation

Use methods such as substring(), and replace() and regular expressions to modify data into different formats or content.

 
#### Searching through arrays

Using if statements inside a for loop, parse through array data to find/match desired information. See the searching through arrays portion of Searching through arrays, innerHTML. Methods that go with seraching include indexOf(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase().


#### Fundamental jQuery Concepts

(covered in Weeks 2-3 and reviewed in Query review and JS):

* Load library and document ready block
* Targeting objects through selectors
* $(document), $(this) and $(window) objects
* Using on() to delay code based on an event/action on an object
* Basic object methods like show and hide, toggle, fadeIn and fadeOut, slideDown and slideUp, etc.
* Methods like html(), css() and attr()
* Using Javascript (if statements, for loops, variables and arrays) inside jQuery


#### Review of Functionality you should be familiar with (in Javascript and jQuery)

* Detect user interaction (with objects) 
* Manipulate objects through their html tag attributes and style properties 
* Store data/objects in variables 
* Store data in arrays/parallel arrays and
	* Randomly pick out information
	* Use/output all data
	* Match and extract one set of data
* Use data to dynamically create items on a page or edit objects 
* Create a "workflow" of events on a page 
* Through logic have a page operate or react differently based on user interaction and/or data 
* Validate and/or change user data
