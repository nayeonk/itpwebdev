JavaScript Debugging
====================

When you're first starting off with JavaScript and the jQuery library (and programming in general), you will likely have lots of typos which will cause your scripts not to work. If you're new to a language, it's nice if someone could point out where you made mistakes so that you can learn from them.

### Chrome Developer Tools to the Rescue!

Luckily, Chrome has some execellent debugging tools. If you open up Tools > JavaScript Console, a panel will open up in the current page. You can also get there by right clicking > Inspect Element > and clicking the Console tab.

As you are writing any JavaScript / jQuery, keep this console open. If you start to see any red, then it means you made a syntax error.

### Editor

If you have decided to use Web Storm, it also has great JavaScript debugging. As you type, it will notify you by highlighting the lines where you made any syntax errors.
