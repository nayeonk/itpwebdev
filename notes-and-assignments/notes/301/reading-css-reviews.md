Reading - CSS references
==============
Demos, references and readings on CSS

W3Schools is an excellent resource for information on html, css, javascript, and most web scripting languages. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is always a good source for official standards and standards-compliance resources and tutorials. Throughout the semester "readings" and resources from these two sites will be used a lot, in addition to useful tips and tutorials from other sites. 

First off, it has a GREAT interactive demo where you can edit page code and a stylesheet and immediately see the effects on a rendered page [here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default). 

A complete reference of all properties, similar to the Resource page on the class site, can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp). 

If you feel you need to review the general theory and mechanics of CSS W3Schools has a sequence set of readings starting [here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp). 

If you are looking an all-in-one-page review of CSS the W3 has a pretty good article [here](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style).
