### Below is an old practical exam from ITP301 (from many years ago):
***********

Below is a list of colors:
*	Blue
*	Red
*	Yellow
*	Green
*	Gray
*	Orange

Below is a list of images:

*	http://webdev.usc.edu/itp204/lab_files/colors/red.jpg
*	http://webdev.usc.edu/itp204/lab_files/colors/yellow.jpg
*	http://webdev.usc.edu/itp204/lab_files/colors/green.jpg
*	http://webdev.usc.edu/itp204/lab_files/colors/gray.gif
*	http://webdev.usc.edu/itp204/lab_files/colors/orange.jpg

Below is a list of phrases:
*	The sky is light blue.
*	A stop sign is red.
*	A lemon is yellow.
*	Grass is green.
*	Many stones are gray.
*	Oranges are of course... orange.

Store the above data in arrays. Now create a page that has the phrase "Learn some common colors!" at the top of the page. 

Each time the page loads, it should randomly pick a color, and then based on the color use document.write statements to dynamically:
*	Display that color as the background color of the page.
*	Display the appropriate graphic on the page
*	Display the appropriate phrase below the image
*	If the color gray is picked a custom alert comes up when the page loads
