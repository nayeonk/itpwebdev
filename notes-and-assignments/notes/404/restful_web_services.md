###Assignment
For this assignment, I want you to pick a REST web service of your choice (that is not one of the examples) and pull data from it. You can browser through a variety of web services at [Programmable Web](http://programmableweb.com).

Once you have chosen a web service, create a PHP script that reads data from it. The response format of the service should either be XML or JSON. You should be able to pass at least one parameter to the service to change the data that is returned.

Lastly, create a simple form page with at least one textbox. The form should submit to your PHP script that pulls data from your chosen web service using the contents of the textbox as a parameter to the service. This way, I should be able to go to your form page, type in a different input each time, and I will be returned different data.
