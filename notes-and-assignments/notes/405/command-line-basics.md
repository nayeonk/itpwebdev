===================

These 3 commands will be the ones you'll mostly commonly use.

* [cd](http://www.usc.edu/its/unix/start/filestructure.html) = change directory
* [ls](http://www.usc.edu/its/unix/commands/file.html) = list files in the current directory
* pwd = print working directory

```
ls
cd ~ # cd to home directory
ls # list files and directories in the current directory
cd ~/Music/iTunes/
```
