W3Schools is a fantastic resource and tutorial site. Instead of using a book on php, we wil use W3Schools as our general reference. 

First off, go ahead and read through the basic introductory material on php and its syntax. Don't get bogged down in any details, just read through the Intro, Syntax, Variables and String for general knowledge. And use the date() as a reference page (especially for formatting).
