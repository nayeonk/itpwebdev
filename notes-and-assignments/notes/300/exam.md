* Regardless of how long you take to complete your written exam, you will have 100 minutes for your practical exam
* For the practical exam you ARE allowed to use any of your notes, past assignments, look up resources, and use lecture notes, etc.
* For the practical exam you will be writing php code and working with a (new to you) mysql database.
* You should expect to write dynamic sql SELECT statements and use if statements and empty() where appropriate. You will NOT have to do dynamic UPDATE or INSERT on the PRACTICAL exam.
* You will be able to view the structure of the exam database through the phpmyadmin web interface, and a relationship schema will also be provided on the exam itself
* Tip - If your query isn't working, die() out your SQL to make sure it is valid before passing the query along to mysql. You can test your query inside of phpmyadmin directly for more informative error messages
