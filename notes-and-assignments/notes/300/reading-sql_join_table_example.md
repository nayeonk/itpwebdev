Very good blog/article laying out a simple and common scenario for creating a join (or in his case a join with data = entity) table.

Don't get tied up in the terminology (why or when a join becomes an entity)... but rather on the initial concept of setting up a table to create relationships between records in two OTHER tables... an then whether that table has JUST foreign keys (tying one record to another) or whether that table also has original "data" describing the relationship/records.
