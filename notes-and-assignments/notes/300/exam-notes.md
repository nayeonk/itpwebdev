* Tips / Notes:
	* Pay attention to exactly what a question is asking you to do, the exact wording of the questions, etc.
	* If you finish early, go back and review the questions and your answers at least once.
	* Take a stab at every question. It's better to put a partial answer and potentially get partial credit than to leave anything blank.

* For the pracical exam you ARE allowed to use any of your notes, past assignments, look up resources, and use lecture notes, etc.
* For the practical exam you will be writing php code and working with a (new to you) mysql database.
* You should expect to write dynamic sql SELECT statements and use if statements and empty() where appropriate. You will NOT have to do dynamic UPDATE or INSERT on the PRACTICAL exam.
* You will be able to view the structure of the exam database through the phpmyadmin web interface, and a relationship schema will also be provided on the exam itself
* Tip - If your query isn't working, die() out your SQL to make sure it is valid before passing the query along to mysql. You can test your query inside of phpmyadmin directly for more informative error messages
