Web Hosting and Other ITP classes.
============

Now, that we are almost done with the entire semester, we already learnt how to build a website with databases. Then what to do next? If you find website development useful and fun, you should build more on your own. Either learn as you go or take some of other ITP web classes to experience more website development theory and technologies. Last, I’m going to show you how do work with your own server(hosting). And introduce you to some our ITP website development classes.


### Web Hosting:
* [Shared Web Hosting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service)

#### cPanel: Most common Control Panel for Linux Web Hosting:  
Login: http://yourdomain.com/cpanel

Password: provided by the hosting company

#### FTP: ftp://yourdomain.com
Username & Password: usually same as your cPanel Account.  

Instead of working on the files directly, you have to use FTP clients (Filezilla, can be found on [USC software](http://software.usc.edu)) upload your PHP files to servers first.

All your website files should be in “public_html” folder, otherwise visitors can’t see them.

Once your uploaded them, you should be able to visit your web pages via urls.

#### Database:
Unlike what we are doing in class, you need to create database and username first in cPanel, then you could manage the database using PHPMyAdmin.
