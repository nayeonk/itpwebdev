*Basic instructions for using the ITP virtual labs*

You all have active accounts on our virtual labs. Your username is your USC email prefix (so mine would be "dent"), and your password is the same one you currently use at USC to log into Oasis, email, etc.

The program you need to connect to the elab should be installed on most Windows machines automatically. For Macs you will need to install the remote connection application.

The elabs are windows environments, but that should not be a problem as all adobe files (photoshop, illustrator and flash) can be worked on in both operating systems.

Connecting to the ITP Virtual Lab

Instructions for logging into the Virtual Labs can be found at vlab_instructions_20120903.pdf. NOTE: Your login username is going to be your normal email prefix@ISD.USC.EDU (in caps)... so for instance m username would be dent@ISD.USC.EDU. 
Additional information on how to copy files from your computer into the vlab are available in Mac and Windows versions.

**If you connecting vLab outside USC network (NOT on USC Wireless/wireless plus, nor in USC labs). Please connect USC VPN from home/starbucks/etc. first, then you could remote login regularly. **
