Reading -- Web SQL resource
=======
**W3Schools SQL resources**

Although we have an optional (tiny) SQL book some student prefer Web resources to physical books. 

So for those who want web reading for SQL, W3Schools has a full SQL intro and tutorial, as well as resource pages. 

W3Schools is an excellent resource and tutorial site on the Web. It is also the site I will be using for the primary reading for the php material in the course.
