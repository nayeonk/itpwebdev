Sample Security
===================
Sample routines and pages from a simple security check (static)

Sample files are [here](http://itp300.usc.edu/dent/security). 

Start by looking at the secure file. It includes the checksecurity file... which in turn if necessary includes the loginform. 

The logout page has a sample logout routine. 


As a separate but parallel example you can download [security_example_20121128.zip](http://webdev.usc.edu/itp300/lecture/security_example_20121128.zip) from the Guest Lecture on Includes and Security from November 28, 2012.
