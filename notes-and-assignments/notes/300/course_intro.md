Course Introduction
===================

### Class administrative details

* During the first two-thirds of the course, there will generally be assignments due every week. During some weeks, there may be lab exercises to complete during lab as well as assignments. But for most assignments, you will be given some lab time to work on and get assistance with projects, if not to complete them entirely.
* Each student will create a Web site as a major individual project. This project will be due near the end of the semester, and will count significantly toward your final grade in the course.
* Weekly information for this class will appear on the Web site webdev.usc.edu/itp300 including lecture notes, lab exercise details, assignment details and deadlines, and miscellaneous class notes and information.

### Grading Information

Final grading for ITP300 generally breaks down as follows (with a 5-percent margin for change):

* Participation: 15%
* Assignments: 30%
* Examination: 20%
* Final Project: 35%

The participation component of your grade consists of lecture attendance, lab attendance and completion of lab exercises. Lecture and attendance is mandatory.
Late assignments can be turned in one week beyond the original due date for one-half credit.

### Course Materials

* [Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes](http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Minutes-Edition/dp/0672336073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375920183&sr=8-1&keywords=teach+yourself+sql+in+10+minutes) is a recommended book. Those students who enter the class without previous experience in SQL traditionally find this supplimental material to be very useful.
* PHP resources: Rather than use a php textbook, the php lectures will be a combination of lecture notes and online resources.
