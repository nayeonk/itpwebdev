Midterm
=======

### Written

The written will be 50 minutes long starting promptly at 5 until 5:50pm. It will cover _mostly_ web application concepts that we have discussed in this class with little amounts of code. The written will be multiple choice, short answer, fill in the blank, and true/false. 

You will __NOT__ have to know:

* php/mysql or php/mysqli database functions
* php superglobal arrays: $_POST, $_SESSION, $_GET, etc
* miscellaneious php functions
* Symfony HttpFoundation component
* Carbon date library
* anything Laravel specific
* working with MySQL datetime

You __WILL__ have to know:

* HTTP life cycle
* Basic SQL
* require statements
* PHP Data Objects (PDO class)
* Defining classes, methods, properties, statics, and inheritance in PHP
* Namespacing
	* Defining a namespace
	* Working with namespaced classes
* Dependency management with Composer
* How composer.json and composer.lock work and why
* Autoloading theory (classmap & psr-0)
* Model-View-Controller architectural pattern
* Object Relational Mapping theory
* Application organization / structure
* Best practices when working with 3rd party APIs
* Testing theory

Any code you will have to write will be very short and target concepts. Many of the questions are scenario based.

The written exam is __closed notes, books, internet, etc__.

### Practical

You will have from 6 - 8pm to complete the practical. I will give you a prompt and you will implement the requirements using Laravel. This portion of the midterm is __open notes, previous assignments, book, and internet__. However, you may not communicate with anyone during the practical.
