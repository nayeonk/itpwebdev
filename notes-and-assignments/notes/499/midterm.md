### Written

The written will be 50 minutes long starting promptly at 5 until 5:50pm. It will cover _mostly_ web application concepts that we have discussed in this class with little amounts of code. The written will be multiple choice, short answer, fill in the blank, and true/false. 

You will __NOT__ have to know:

* php/mysql or php/mysqli database functions
* php superglobal arrays: $_POST, $_SESSION, $_GET, etc
* Symfony HttpFoundation component
* Carbon date library
* anything Laravel specific
* working with MySQL datetime

You __WILL__ have to know:

* Development environments and workflow
* HTTP life cycle
* Basic SQL
* PHP Data Objects
* Namespacing
* Composer & autoloading theory (classmap & psr-0)
* Model-View-Controller theory

* ORM theory

__More will be added to this last as we have more lectures__

The written exam is __closed notes, books, internet, etc__.

### Practical

You will have from 6 - 8pm to complete the practical. I will give you a prompt and you will implement the requirements using Laravel. This portion of the midterm is __open notes, previous assignments, book, and internet__. You may not communicate with anyone during the practical.
