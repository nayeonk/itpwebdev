Midterm Information & Study Guide
===========

### Midterm Information

There are two components of the exam:
1. **Written:** 50 minute paper exam with fill in the blanks, multiple choice, etc that tests your terminology and conceptual knowledge
2. **Practical:** 90 minute exam on your laptop where you will be coding a simple webpage from scratch. A picture of the expected end result will be provided.

Important notes:
* Both exames are **NO NOTES**, no books, no web resources, no using past assignemnts or labs.
* You WILL need to have memorized the common HTML tags and their attributes
* You will need to know how to **USE** CSS but will not have to memorize particular style properties (e.g. font-size, background-color, etc). Both exams will have partial lists of style property names where needed.
* For the practical exam, you can ONLY use an approved text editor: Notepad, Notepad++, TextEdit, Brackets, TextWrangler, Sublime Text or Komodo Edit -- NO DREAMWEAVER or other visual editor. Ask the instructor if your editor is not listed.
* You may not access web resources, but you may open your HTML file on a browser to check your work.

* HTML tags that create basic these form elements:
    * text
    * radio buttons
