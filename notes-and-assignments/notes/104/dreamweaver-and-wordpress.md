### Tools to create websites
In this class we have learned how to build a website using the basic building blocks - HTML and CSS. With websites being in so much demand, many tools have been created over the years to help you build websites faster and easier. Today we will talk about two popular tools used to build websites faster -- Adobe's Dreamweaver and WordPress. Though both these software help you build websites, they do it very different ways so it is important to know what categories each fall in. Dreamweaver became popular because it was a **WYSIWG editor** - What You See is What You Get. Meaning you were able to see how your website looked in real time as you edited it. WordPress became popular because it was a CMS - Content Management System - that made it very easy to manage content (like blogs).

### Adobe Dreamweaver
* Originally created by Macromedia (the same company that created Flash) in 1997, but was acquired by Adobe in 2005.
* A software you have to purchase from Adobe (monthly subscription).
* Allows you to build HTML elements without knowing much code. Key elements are built in the user interface so that it you can simply click and your elements appear.
* Was extremely popular in the early 2000s. 
* Has animations, behaviors, and other interactive elements built in so that it is easy to add them into your site without much difficulty.

### WordPress
* A free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.
* Must be installed on a web server, not a desktop software like Dreamweaver.
* In its basic form, it is more of a management tool than a website creation tool. However, due to the numerous plugins and themes that have been developed by third-parties, WordPress became a powerful website builder.
