Intro to WordPress
==================

### Quick Facts about WordPress
* Free and open source content management system (CMS)
* As of Jan 2015, used by more than 23% of the top 10 million websites
* Is essentially a blogging system, but people have retrofitted it to use as all kinds of websites - news, shopping, and more
* You can either download WordPress from [https://www.wordpress.org](www.wordpress.org) and host it on your own web server, OR set up a site quickly at [https://www.wordpress.com](www.wordpress.com). For our class demo purposes, we will all create a website on wordpress.com. 


### Admin Panel
After you create a wordpress site, you will be led to the "Dashboard" which looks something like this:

Think of this as the control center for your website. This is where you can add content on your wordpress website, edit the look & feel, install plugins, and more.

You can add a number of users to be an 'admin' of the website. Only admins can see this admin panel and edit the site. Be careful, anything done here can be automatically affect the site. These changes would be changed live if this site is already live.

### Appearance
This menu is where you can handle all the look and feel of the website. 

#### Themes
Themes are "outfits" of your website. There are many free ones created by other people. You can choose which 'outfit' you want the website to weare. Some outfits come with the whole shibang - fancy sliders, social media widgets built in, basic animations, and more. Others are very basic and allow you to customize it more to your liking. You can browse through themes and pick the one that best matches the type of site you want to create.

#### Basic customization of theme
After you choose the theme that you like, you can leave it as is, or you can adjust it by clicking on 'Customize.' Each theme has its own variety of options under this menu.

#### Widgets
These are snippets of code you can add to your site. Some commonly used widgets are social media share buttons, recent posts, and calendar. You can drag and drop widgets into sections of your site.

### Adding Content - Posts
This is where you can create a 'post' for your site. Think blog and/or article post. The interface to write a post is very straightforward and easy to use. You can even add HTML/CSS inside the post for some quick styling.

You can create new categories and tags for posts to have. This makes it easy to filter your posts.

### Adding Content - Pages
A page is similar to posts in that this is another place to add content. However, pages should be used for unique and set pages like About, Contact Us, Mission Statement, and more. 

#### Page Templates
For pages, themes have different page templates you can choose for pages. For example, there could be templates for one-column layout, two-column layout, and etc.
