### The World Wide Web

*   Webpages are created using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
*   HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language. HTML is used to structure the content of your web page
*   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the look and feel of the web page. CSS is used for things like color, borders, padding and margins, fonts, positioning, etc
*   Browsers allow you to view webpages. I recommend using Chrome when you are starting out building web pages.
    *   Internet Explorer
    *   Firefox
    *   Google Chrome
    *   Opera
    *   Safari
*   HTML files have the file extension _.html_
*   To create an HTML file, all you need is a simple Text Editor such as:
   *   Notepad
   *   Wordpad
   *   Notepad++
   *   TextMate
   *   Komodo Edit
   *   Dreamweaver

There are many text editors available. __Microsoft Word is not a plain text editor. It is a rich text editor.__

### Client Server Environment
*   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP / HTTPS) is the communication protocol for the Internet
*   A browser uses HTTP to request for web pages on a server.
*   Web servers have IP addresses associated with them. An IP address looks like (192.68.20.50)
*   IP addresses typically have a domain name associated with it (i.e. www.usc.edu), which is just an alias to the IP address
*   A web server responds to an HTTP request with an HTML document (a web page) using HTTP and your browser renders the HTML and CSS to display the web page.

### Introduction to HTML

Create a text file using a plain text editor with a .html file extension and place the following code inside it:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

Content / text in a web page is surrounded by opening and closing tags. &lt;h3&gt; represents the heading's opening tag and &lt;/h3&gt; represents the heading's closing tag.
