### Using position 
So far we have been creating layouts using CSS float. Using positions can allow us to detach divs or other elements from the "document flow," which means we can use it to overlap other elements.

There are four values of the position property:
1. static (this is default)
2. relative
3. absolute
4. fixed

Meaning we can use the property like this

```
div {
    position: relative; /* can replace relative with absolute or fixed */
}
```
