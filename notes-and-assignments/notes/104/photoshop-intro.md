Always keep __TWO VERSIONS__ of each graphic file

When you build graphics ALWAYS have a separate "authoring" version in whatever program you are working, such as PSD for Photoshop. Do NOT edit in GIF or JPG format.

When you are done building your graphic, you will EXPORT it in the actual format you want for your web page such as jpg, gif or png.

For instance, if I were building a title graphic in Photoshop, I would have the PSD authoring file, with its record of layers and effects et al, and then I would have the final GIF that I exported (Save for the Web) out of Photoshop. Or if I were building a series of navigation graphics, I might have the PSD file with all of the layers and graphic elements, and then individually save out the GIFs for each graphic (for placement on the Web page).

Remember: You do NOT place/link authoring files (like PSD) on Web pages, but rather Web formats like GIF and JPG.


 
### Photoshop 1-2-3-4

Here are some VERY basic notes on the fundamentals of Photoshop:

1. When you start a new document in Photoshop, enter in the size of graphic you want to create (usually in pixels) and set the Backgrund to Transparent
2. When you are building a graphic in Photoshop, there are four basic interfaces:
  * Main layout/canvas area where the graphic that you are building is located
  * Toolbar to the left (by default), with all of your main tools for working with shapes, text, selections, colors, etc.
  * Option window, usually at the top, that gives you informatio and lets you control the parameters of the current tool (such as the size and color of text when working with the Text tool).
  * Layer window, generally located on the right, where you build up the "layers" of your graphics... generally one element (box, lines, pictures, text) per layer
3. Periodically save your file as a PSD.
4. When you are done, use Save for Web to save the export/web page version of graphics. REMINDER: You do NOT place a PSD one a page. You CREATE in PSD format, then save/export a copy as a gif, jpg or png to place on a web page.

### Advantage of advanced graphic programs

In building your navigations, use a graphic application such as Photoshop that uses layers.

The more advanced applications will also often have sophisticted filters, effects, processes and wizards to save you time in creatng things like drop-shadows, fixing bad images, creating advanced effects, etc.

If you do use Photoshop, and are not as familiar with its operation, don't hesitate to use the Help files in the program. There is also a resource link on the 104 site to 'Photoshop Basics'. And of course all USC studens have access to the free Lynda.com training videos... which has more than one hundred on Photoshop alone!


 
### Consistency

Whenever creating graphics for your site, strive for consistency. If you are using red, make sure it is the same red in repeated elements.

Decide upon a general color pallete or combinations of colors you will be using. For instance, there should be a common color theme or style between your navigation graphics and the title graphic for your site.

Also, the core underlying structures of repeated elements (such as the button component of navigation buttons) should be the same, or at least if they vary that should be an intentional choice and not sloppy production.


 
### Navigation and button tips

If you are building graphics with repeated elements, such as a button graphic, create those elements ONCE and place them in a layer. Then create the overlay objects that change (such as the text of each navigation buttons) in separate layers. Then all you have to do is change the visibility of layers to create each graphic. This makes sure that your graphics are uniform and do not vary (unintentionally).

If you use Photoshop to create navigation buttons, try experimenting with applying 'layer effects' to a layer that has the main graphic background. For instance, add a drop shadow or bevel to a oval button.

Also, try playing around with using icons or images in graphics. Rather than just creating static shapes for buttons, see if you can come up with iconographic approaches. While they may still have text labels, pictures and icon graphics often give people a more visceral understand of (and connection with) your content and site.
