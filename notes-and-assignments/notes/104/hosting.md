Web Hosting
===========

### Different Hosting Plans

* Inexpensive: $5-$10/month hosts. Tend to come with more pre-installed scripts/programs you can use.
* Dedicated Web hosts: Range from $30-$300/month. Tend to have the best up-time and technical support (for their servers, not your site).
	* Dedicated Servers with GoDaddy: http://www.godaddy.com/Hosting/dedicated-servers.aspx
	* Verio: http://hosting.verio.com/index.php/web_webcompare.html
	      
	    
### Hosting Features

Different plans have different features and services. For the inexpensive option, you can see 3 different levels of hosting packages and what each provides: [GoDaddy Comparison Chart](http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting.aspx?ci=8971G)

Here is a list of some features you will typically see and use:

* Database: The 'open source' solutions are often free (MySQL, etc.), while the commercial databases (from Access to SQL Server to Oracle) are usually extra charges, and sometimes substantially so.
* Forums: Many hosts have forum software pre-installed so that you can easily add forums to your web site. Some are free and some are add-on costs to hosting plan
* Scripts: Most Web hosts have a suite of scripts for common tasks (such as e-mailing the contents of forms on pages), typically in Perl. 
* E-commerce: Shopping carts, online CC transactions, etc., tend to cost extra or to be bundled in higher-cost plans e-commerce plans.
* Traffic reports: Most major Web hosts include at least basic reports generated by programs such as Webtrends. Also, most plans above the basic level allow you access (to download or process yourself) to the raw log files that record your site's traffic.
* PHP/ASP/ColdFusion/.NET: Active Server Pages (ASP) is usually standard on any Windows based web server and PHP is standard on Linux web servers. PHP and ASP are typically free; ColdFusion is usually extra.
* Secure Server: SSL connections are typically included in mid-range and e-commerce plans.
	  
### How to Host your Website in 3 Steps

#### 1. Register a Domain Name

* A domain name is a pointer/alias to an IP address, a unique number to identify a device/machine. When you make a request for a specific domain name like (www.usc.edu), your computer accesses a Domain Name Server (DNS) to look up the IP address associated with that domain name. Once the domain name is resolved, your computer makes a request to the server with that IP address to fetch the webpage you asked for
* <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm">Great article on how Domain Name Servers work</a>
* All domain names are registered in a central registry maintained by ICANN (Internet Coproration for Assigned Names and Numbers)
* ICANN certifies domain name registrars like [Go Daddy](http://www.godaddy.com) or [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/)
* You can choose any name you want (given that it is available), but it should reflect what your website is about. Domain names can only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens and it is limited to 70 characters. Domain names also can be upper or lower case, but case is ignored by Domain Name Servers (DNS)
* Extensions available(.com, .cm, .biz, .net, .us, .edu, .gov)
* Find a domain name using a site like <a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Instant Domain Search</a> instead of typing into the URL bar . Once you’ve found a domain name, register your domain name with a domain registrar. Prices vary considerably depending on the domain registrar you choose. In the past, I have always found Go Daddy to be the cheapest (more on this)

* Domain names are usually registered for a minimum of one year, but usually you can register your domain name for longer than that. Typically, the longer the contract, the cheaper the domain name


#### 2. Find a web host

* At this point, all you have is a domain name. However, you don’t have a server to host your website, so you now need a server to host your files. You will link up your hosting server with your domain name
* Rather than doing Step 1 (registering a domain name) and Step 2 (finding web hosting) separately, you can register a domain name and sign up for hosting in one process. If we wanted to use GoDaddy, we would create an account on their site and purchase a domain name and web hosting.
* When you are browsing hosting plans, it will ask you to choose an operating system. On GoDaddy for example, it will ask you to choose between Linux or Windows. This does not mean the operating system of your local computer. This refers to the operating system of the server. The default is Linux, which is typically what you want. If you start using more Microsoft technologies (like ASP.NET, SQL Server), you will probably want Windows. 
* You can usually find coupon codes when buying web hosting. Google something like “coupon code GoDaddy” and you will find various discounts. In the end, hosting a site for a year will typically range from $40-$65 depending on the discount you find.

#### 3. Upload your files using FTP

After you’ve purchased a domain name and web hosting, you will be sent an email with FTP information so that you can upload your website files using an FTP client like Fetch, Cyberduck, or FileZilla. This process will be just like how you uploaded to the aludra.usc.edu server.
