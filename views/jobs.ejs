<h1>Web Development Opportunities</h1>

<p>March 24, 2014</p>

<p>My name is David Black and I am a USC faculty member at the Keck
School of Medicine. I was looking at your USC IT program website in
hopes of locating a student who you think is proficient in web
development (for example, simple design and layout templates for ~20
pages in Wordpress).</p>

<p>I have founded a research association and I was hoping you might help
me identify a student who may be interested in building their
portfolio by helping me build a professional website. I can provide a
stipend for the student up to $500 depending on time needed.</p>

<p>Thank you for your guidance for locating a student that might fit well
for this role at USC.</p>

We are looking for a web developer to assist our team in developing a website for a fairly extensive project for the Cinema School. While we can't pay, the project itself has the opportunity to be shown to some high profile people across multiple industries, with the possibility of growing into something major and more long term.
<br><br>
We are looking for someone preferably with skills in Wordpress, some css and some php though those are not essential if you can demonstrate good enough skill in developing a website a different way. 
<br><br>
You also must be in a position to meet with us at least 1-2 times a week, as well as make some pretty decent progress relatively fast.
<br><br>
If you're interested, or want more information, please send me an email at bskaggs@usc.edu.
